This project simply installs Yarn in the most optimal way possible, on the
already slim Debian Slim install.

It also adds the `curl` and `zip` binaries.

## How to use

To use it, install it from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/roelofr/node-yarn/), or use the command below.

```sh
docker pull roelofr/node-yarn
```
